### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find command allows the user to filter the list of contacts by (at least one) criteria applied to data field(s) (`Name`, `Email`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Detail` and/or `StudyGroupTags`). Each field correspond to one criteria, and can consist of one or more keywords. The list of persons in the `AddressBook` is filtered, then displayed to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `n/Alice Bob` is a single criteria, while `n/Alice e/@example.com` is two criteria.

</div>

The user executes a find command with some inputs, for e.g. `find n/Alex Bernice t/1A`, which goes through the `Logic` component as shown by the following sequence diagram:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

For each criteria, a `Predicate` is initialised in the `Model` component as shown below:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram-PredicateModel.png)

The `PredicateGroup` consist of one or more `Predicate`. The following sequence diagram shows how a `PredicateGroup` is used to test a `Person` record:

![PredicateGroupSequenceDiagram](images/PredicateGroupSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Handling multiple criteria**<br>
Criteria are segregated by data field, and each criteria is independently evaluated.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**  For a person to be included, they must _satisfy all criteria_.
  * Pros: Allow the find command to filter very specific criteria that must all be fulfilled, enabling more accurate results.
  * Cons: May return fewer results, especially when using multiple criteria.

* **Alternative 2:** For a person to be included, they only need to _satisfy one criteria_.
  * Pros: Returns wider range of results, potentially finding more relevant person records.
  * Cons: Less specific when finding for exact match.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Researchers who,
* have a need to manage a significant number of study participants
* need an easy way to contact different experimental groups
* need quick access to study participants' information
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using *CLI* apps

**Value proposition**:

As researchers have to handle large groups of participants across multiple studies, `ResearchRoster` allows them to
* have all participants consolidated in a single program
* consolidate a list of contact details based on **specific experimental criteria**
* export it to an easy-to-read format for better data organization

Thus, *ResearchRoster* allows researchers to save time, effort and energy whilst keeping their participant data well-organised.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### General requirements

* The software should be offered as a free product/service.
* The source code should be open source.

#### Constraints

* The data should be stored locally in a human-editable text file (allowing advanced users to modify data directly).
* The software should have minimal reliance on network connectivity and include fallback mechanisms for any network-dependent features.
* The software should not depend on the developerâ€™s remote server.
* The software should be distributed as a single `.jar` file. If that is not feasible, the `.jar` file and any required files should be packaged into a single `.zip` file.
* The software should not exceed 100 MB in size, and document files (i.e., `PDF`s of documentation) should not exceed 15 MB each. Neither should be unnecessarily bloated.
* Any third-party frameworks, libraries or services used should be free, open-source (except for services) and permissively licensed. They should not require users to install additional software or create accounts.
* The developer and user guides should be `PDF`-friendly (by avoiding expandable panels, embedded videos, animated `GIF`s etc.).

#### Quality

* The software should be optimized for the target users: fast typists should be able to complete most tasks more efficiently using the _CLI_ than a _GUI_.
* The software should be intuitive and easy for first-time users to navigate (by providing sample data, a `help` command to access the user guide etc.).
* Multistep commands for onboarding (if any) should have a streamlined, one-step equivalent for regular or expert users.
* The _GUI_ should be intuitive for users who are not tech-savvy.

#### Performance and Efficiency

* The software should respond to user actions within 5 seconds.

#### Scalability

* The software should be able to accommodate up to 5,000 contacts, without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

#### Reliability

* The software should maintain stable operation (i.e., function as intended) at least 99.9% of the time.

#### Robustness

* **Disaster Recovery and Fault Tolerance:** The software should gracefully handle exceptional events (e.g., errors or failures) without losing data or compromising functionality (e.g., crashing).
* **Error Handling:** Clear, informative error messages should be provided, and errors logged to aid troubleshooting and support.

#### Compliance

* The software should protect research participants' confidentiality and comply with relevant legal standards (by safeguarding _private contact details_).

#### Portability

* The software should work without requiring an installer.
* The software should run on any _mainstream OS_ that has `Java 17` (and no other Java version installed).
* The _GUI_ should be free from resolution-related inconveniences for standard screen resolutions (1920x1080 or higher) and screen scales (100% and 125%).
* The _GUI_ should remain functional, though not necessarily optimized, for resolutions of 1280x720 or higher and screen scales of 150%.

#### Maintainability

* **Code Quality:** The code should be well-maintained and follow best practices.
* **Documentation:** Clear, consistent and accurate documentation is required.
* **Testability:** Implemented features should not impede testing or make the software difficult to test.

#### Process Requirements

* The project should follow a development schedule that delivers incremental versions on a weekly basis.

#### Notes about project scope

* Input should primarily be via the _CLI_, with the _GUI_ mainly providing visual feedback.
* The software does not need to support the printing of reports or contacting research participants.
* The software is intended for single-user operation, not multi-user functionality.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **UI**: User Interface - The medium through which users interact with a system, encompassing both graphical (*GUI*) and text-based (*CLI*) elements
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface - A visual-based interface where users interact with the system through graphical elements like icons and windows
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface - A text-based interface where users interact with the system by typing commands
